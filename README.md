# Flower-Classification-News
# Flower Classification News 📰🌸

A deep‑learning project to classify flower species and generate news‑style summaries of classification results.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of different flower species (e.g.: rose, daisy, tulip, sunflower, dandelion). Beyond image classification, it also produces "news‑style" descriptive summaries based on predictions—ideal for automatically generating visual result reports.

## ⚙️ Features

- **CNN-based image classifier** (built and/or with transfer learning)
- **Preprocessing & data augmentation** (resizing, normalization, flips, rotations)
- **Training and evaluation pipeline** (splitting, metrics calculation, confusion matrix)
- **Summary generator**: produces natural‑language descriptions like “A sunflower was identified with 94% confidence…”
- **Easy CLI or notebook interface** for training, inference, and summary output

📊 Evaluation
Look at logs/ and plots/ for training curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports showing accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score.

🌱 Future Work
Add more flower species or larger datasets
Experiment with advanced architectures (e.g. ResNet50, EfficientNet)
Improve language generation: richer summaries or multiple sentences
Build a simple web or mobile frontend for live image submission

📄 Project Description
Purpose & Motivation
The Flower Classification News project aims to combine computer vision and automated language generation to build tools that not only classify flower species accurately but also produce human-style descriptive summaries. This hybrid approach is useful in educational tools, digital botanist reports, and accessible AI showcases.

Key Components
Image Classification Module
Uses CNN-based models (built from scratch or via transfer learning)
Trained on labeled flower image datasets (e.g. five flower types: rose, daisy, tulip, sunflower, dandelion)
Includes preprocessing and data augmentation.

Summarizer Module
Generates concise, readable news-style text for each classification
Example output: “The model detected a daisy with 92% confidence; daisies are delicate white‑petaled flowers often found in spring.”

Training & Evaluation Pipelines
Supports dataset splitting, model training, validation, and testing
Tracks metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score, and confusion matrix for performance assessment

User Interface
Command-line interface or Jupyter notebook examples to load images and get both predictions and summaries

Dataset & Model Details
Often, flower classification datasets include five common species and thousands of labeled images for training. The CNN model architecture may range from custom sequential layers to transfer‑learning based architectures like ResNet50, VGG19, or EfficientNet, achieving training accuracy up to ~98% and test accuracy around 94% depending on data and augmentation perfomance.

Use Cases
Botany education platforms: Students upload flower images, receive both classification and context.
Citizen science apps: Non‑experts photograph flowers and automatically get species info plus language description.
Demo or portfolio projects: Merges CV and NLP for seminars or technical showcases.

🛠️ Customization Tips
Add new flower classes: Extend folders and retrain with new species data.
Upgrade model architecture: Swap in transformer-based vision models or ensembles.
Enhance language output: Use templates or simple language models for richer summaries.
Deploy in production: Wrap into a REST API or use a lightweight app via Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI.
